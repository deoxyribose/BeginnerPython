# Generate list of triangle numbers up to 26 squared.
# A triangle number is given by the formula Â½*t*(t+1)
# Assign a list of all uppercase letters to alpha
# For every word in the words.txt
# For every letter in every word
# Append the corresponding number to the letter. Python counts from 0, so add 1.
# If the sum of the numbers is a triangle number
# Append the word to triword
# Find how many words there are in triword
